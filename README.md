# libft
libft is the first project as a student at 42. You have to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.

The indentation is weird in libft.h and for some variable declarations because of Github, everything is respecting <a href="https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf">the Norm</a>
